Overloading:
When same name method is existing in class multiple times with different number of parameters
or diff sequence of parameters or diff data types
then it is called method overloading.
- Benefits:
Cleanliness of code
Flexible code
Easy for end user

-Rules:
1.Access modifiers (public,private,etc..) do not play any role in method overloading.
2.Non-access modifiers (static,final,etc..) do not play any role in method overloading.
3.Method return types also don't play any role in method overloading we can't overload- a method by just changing the return type.
4.Method names must be same if we want to overload a method.
5.Parameters should be diff for each method either in number or in sequence or in data types.
6.We can overload a constructor,private methods, main method.
=====================================================================

Overriding:
Overrriding happens when same methods exists in parent and child class.
Benefits:
-We can have specific implementation for a method that is already defined in the Parent class.
-That we have this flexibility that we don't have to come up with diff names if we doing same thing again in child class.
Rules:
-We can change the access modifiers in child class but we can make it only less restrictive for ex. we can change
protected or default or public but we cannot do the reverse.(we can increase the visibility but we cannot decrese it)
-Static methods have the same rules but we use a diff terminology we say we are re-declaring a method instead of overriding.
-Return types must be same in overriding.
-name must be same
-parameters should be same
-we cannot override a private method/field or constructor because they don't participate in inheritance.
