Constructors:
is special block of code that help us build/construct (giving initial values to the fields) the object;
1.when we write new ClassName() this is he code that executes the constructor for that class.
2.when we do not write a constructor - a default constructor is provided by Java compiler.
3.If there are multiple constructors in a class -
Java will check the number of parameters, type of parameters and sequence of parameters.
4.Rules:
-Constructors have same name as the class name
-don't have a return types, not even void
-this() to invoke the other constructors of the same class
-this can be used to differentiate local and instance variables
